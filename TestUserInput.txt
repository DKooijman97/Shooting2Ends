280	<--Number of meshpoints for three point scheme, needs to be high enough for the shooting to converge (280 enough) 
-1 1    <--start interval/ end interval, must be integers
1       <--Potential type: 1: Infinite walls, 2: Finite walls, 3: Gaussian potential
10      <--Number of energy states, starting from n=0. 
400     <--Number of meshpoints for shooting algorithm
